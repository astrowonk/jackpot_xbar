This is a simple extension which will show Mega Millions and Powerball Jackpot sizes. Icon and text will be green if the prize is over $200 Million.

Requires python 3.6+ and requests, which you can install easily with pip or your preferred python package manager.

```
$> pip install requests
```

or perhaps if you're using stock MacOS python and that didn't work try (not 100% sure how pip works with stock mac python)

```
$> /usr/bin/python3 -m pip install requests
```
